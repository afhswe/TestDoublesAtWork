# Test Doubles Coding Kata - Table Booking Service

## Introduction

This coding kata is dedicated to practice writing good unit tests for code with different types of dependencies.
It focuses on understanding the *difference between the various types of test doubles* and when to use which of these.

## Assignment

Try to get code with **business logic** (i.e. **behaviour**) under test and to increase code coverage by applying different types of test doubles.
The main focus is *TableBookingService::BookTable()* but you can of course add additional tests to other components if deemed useful.

Focus on writing tests that cover the verification of expected business behaviour rather than just following the code.

Try to write **robust tests** that are not bound to implementation details which are not relevant to the context of the current test. 

Have fun :-)
